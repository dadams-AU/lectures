### Navigating the Repository

The repository is organized by course number and semester. Each course folder contains the LaTeX (`lecture.tex`) or Markdown (`lecture.md`) source file and a compiled PDF (`lecture.pdf`) for easy viewing.

### Customizing the Lectures

To create or modify lecture materials, use the `lecture.md` files in each course folder. These files are well-commented to assist you in understanding and adjusting the LaTeX code. The `lecture.pdf` files serve as a reference for the final output.
